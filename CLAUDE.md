# CLAUDE.md — Rose Next Classic

## Project Overview

Rose Next Classic is a modernized ROSE Online private server + client built on the original iROSE C++ codebase. The server uses PostgreSQL (replacing MSSQL). The client is a DirectX 9 Win32 application. Everything is **32-bit x86 Windows**.

## Architecture

```
Client (C++/DX9)  ←→  LoginServer (C++)  ←→  WorldServer (C++)  ←→  GameServer (C++)
                                    ↕                ↕                    ↕
                              PostgreSQL DB     Game Data (STB/STL)   Game Data
```

- **Client:** `src/client/` — DX9, Win32, packet-based networking
- **Servers:** `src/sho_loginserver/`, `src/sho_worldserver/`, `src/sho_gameserver/`
- **Shared C++:** `src/common/` (calculations, items, quests), `src/common-server/` (IOCP sockets, SQL threads)
- **Shared Rust:** `src/common-lib/` — FFI library (logger, config parsing, FlatBuffers codegen)
- **Engine:** `src/engine/` — 3D rendering, terrain, effects
- **UI framework:** `src/tgamectrl/` — custom GUI controls
- **Pipeline:** `src/pipeline/` (Rust) — asset baking tool

## Build System

Mixed Rust (i686-pc-windows-msvc) + C++ (VS2019, x86). Three-phase build:

```powershell
# Full build (recommended)
just build release    # or: scripts/build.ps1 -config release

# Manual steps:
# 1. Build thirdparty C++ deps
MSBuild.exe thirdparty.sln -p:Configuration=release;Platform=x86
# 2. Build Rust crates (MUST be i686)
cd src/ && cargo +stable-i686-pc-windows-msvc build --release
# 3. Build Rose Next C++ projects
MSBuild.exe rose-next.sln -p:Configuration=release;Platform=x86
```

### Key build facts
- Rust toolchain override: `stable-i686-pc-windows-msvc` in `src/`
- Cargo target dir: `bin/` (set in `src/.cargo/config`)
- Output binaries: `bin/release/` — rosenext.exe, sho_gameserver.exe, sho_loginserver.exe, sho_worldserver.exe, pipeline.exe
- Thirdparty output: `bin/release/thirdparty/`
- `ntdll.lib` is a required linker dependency for client and all servers
- Build assets: `just build-assets release` or `scripts/build-assets.ps1`

## Database

- PostgreSQL 12+
- Connection configured in `server.toml` (see `doc/server.toml.example`)
- Migrations in `database/migrations/` — squash with `scripts/squash-migrations.ps1`
- Passwords: SHA256 + salt (generate with `scripts/generate-password.py`)

## Networking

- Custom packet-based protocol over TCP (IOCP on server side)
- FlatBuffers for some packet types (defined in `src/common-lib/packets/*.fbs`)
- C++ packet definitions in `src/common/include/rose/network/`
- Client has separate socket connections: Login → World → Game server

## Code Conventions

- C++ formatting: clang-format (run `python scripts/format_code.py`)
- `.clang-format-ignore` for exclusions
- Rust: standard `cargo fmt`
- Prefix conventions: `C` for classes (CItem, CObjCHAR), `m_` for members, `g_` for globals
- Server packet handlers: `Recv_cli_*` / `Send_gsv_*` naming
- Client packet handlers: `Recv_gsv_*` / `Send_cli_*` naming

## Dev Environment

```powershell
just dev-setup              # Creates dev/ symlinks for assets
just client release         # Run client
just server-all release     # Run all servers
just loginserver release    # Run individual server
```

- Client looks for assets in `dev/game/`
- Servers look for data in `data/` (configurable in server.toml)
- Auto-connect: `rosenext.exe --server 127.0.0.1 --username user --password pass --auto-connect-server 1 --auto-connect-channel 1 --auto-connect-character CharName`

## Important Patterns

### Combat Damage Presentation
Combat damage is server-authoritative. The server calculates and applies HP once, then sends FlatBuffer `DamageEvent` / `CombatSwing` packets containing the final `damage_value`, `hp_after`, `presentation_kind`, and `lethal` checkpoint. Legacy `GSV_DAMAGE_OF_SKILL` packets also carry authoritative `m_iHP_AFTER`; the client must not synthesize combat skill checkpoints from visible HP. The client must not recalculate live combat damage.

The client queues `DamageEvent`s per defender in `CObjCHAR::m_CombatDamageQueue`. `CombatSwing` queues the event before starting the confirmed attack animation; `Hitted()` consumes exactly one matching event at the visual hit frame. Projectile damage is queued on receive and presented only on projectile impact. If hard control such as sleep/faint interrupts an attacker before its confirmed normal swing can spawn or reach its hit/projectile consumer, the client discards that exact queued event by `event_id`, folds the server-applied HP silently into the next real presentation, and immediately presents avatar death if the orphan was lethal. Direct HP stat packets (`UpdateStats.hp`, `GSV_SET_HPnMP`) update authoritative shadow HP; lower HP never silently moves the visible bar during combat.

HP convergence is hidden from floating digits. `DamageEvent.damage_value` is the displayed hit number, while folded reconciliation/checkpoint drift only affects visible HP and death state. Local-avatar dead reconciliation becomes pending authoritative death: outgoing attacks show MISS/no damage until the next incoming monster hit presents death, except mutual-death cases where the avatar dies immediately after the monster's normal lethal presentation. When the avatar kills its only/last attacker mid-swing, the drain-on-death path presents the mutual death immediately on the kill (no incoming hit is coming). A `CObjCHAR::Proc()` backstop forces the death after ~1.5 s if the avatar is left pending-dead with no presentation (no-attacker kills like DoT/fall damage), so the player is never stranded alive-client / dead-server and frozen. Remote/non-avatar lethal melee events also have a ~1.5 s spectator fallback: if the killer animation never consumes the queued death on this client, the defender still runs `Dead()` instead of remaining visually alive. See client `CLAUDE.md` for details.

### Bone Particle Budget (Client/Engine)
Cosmetic character bone effects created by `CCharMODEL::CreateBoneEFFECT` are tracked separately by `CBoneEffectBudget` (`src/client/BoneEffectBudget.*`). This budget exists for passive bone-attached aura/loop effects only; skill, hit, projectile, terrain, weather, weapon, and normal world effects must not be registered there.

The manager budgets visible bone-effect groups by estimated particle capacity and emit rate, then applies particle-only tiers through `CEffect::SetParticleTier`: Full, Reduced, Minimal, Off. Mesh and sound components remain unchanged. Runtime caps and emit scaling are enforced in the engine particle emitter/sequence code, so degraded/off tiers are actually cheaper instead of only hidden. Current relaxed budgets are 480 runtime particles, 360 emit/sec, and 3 full duplicate groups per same NPC/effect signature. The debug HUD exposes this as the `BoneFx:` line.

Additive-compatible bone particles also opt into safe texture batching through `CEffect::SetParticleBatchRenderHint`, forwarded to `zz_particle_emitter`. Only `CreateBoneEFFECT` enables this hint. The engine batches hinted additive sequences by texture/render state in `zz_particle_emitter::RenderParticleListWithBatching`; incompatible particles and all non-bone effects use the old render path. The debug HUD exposes batching as the `PartBatch:` line.

### Server Zone Architecture
GameServer manages zones via `gs_threadzone` — each zone runs in its own thread. Players are tracked per-sector for efficient broadcasting (`send_packet_nearby()` checks 9 adjacent sectors).

### Summon Control (CTRL+Click)
Players can directly command their summons with CTRL+click: on terrain → all summons move there; on a hostile monster → all summons attack it. Non-CTRL clicks are unchanged, and CTRL+click is only hijacked when the player actually owns a summon. The client (`jcommandstate.cpp` `TrySummonControlClick`, hooked into both single- and double-click paths) sends the shared `CLI_SUMMON_CONTROL` packet; the server (`classUSER::Recv_cli_SUMMON_CONTROL` → `CZoneTHREAD::CommandSummons_MoveTo`/`_Attack`) is authoritative. `CObjSUMMON` holds a ~5 s manual-order window that suppresses its follow-the-owner loop and AIP auto-aggro, then resumes normal following. Move orders use `CObjSUMMON::PlayerOrderMoveTo` (tolerant of non-walkable cells) — **not** `SetCMD_MOVE2D`, whose `IsMovablePOS` gate silently drops clicks. See the client and gameserver `CLAUDE.md` files for details.

### Shared Data Types
`src/common/shared/` contains game data structures (items, quests, inventory, economy) used by both client and server. Changes here affect both sides.

### Item Encoding And Package Items
Item headers are shared wire data between client and server. `tagBaseITEM` uses a 5-bit item type plus an 11-bit item number so item IDs above 1023 (for example use-item boxes `10:1060`-`10:1062`) round-trip correctly. The created flag is server-only state on `tagITEM`; do not put it back into the packed 16-bit header or the client will decode high IDs as wrapped lower IDs (for example `10:1060` becoming `10:36`).

When creating items from explicit type/id pairs, use the type/id initializer instead of the legacy `type * 1000 + id` packed integer format. The latter cannot represent item numbers above 999. This matters for `/item`, package rewards, and any code path that spawns or grants modern high-numbered use items.

Use-item class `322` is a package box: the value in `LIST_USEITEM.STB` `ADD_DATA_VALUE` selects a server-side reward package. Unknown package IDs should fail without consuming the box so missing package mappings are visible and recoverable.

### Item Import Tooling
`scripts/import-weapon.py` imports a weapon from another ROSE data dump (e.g. an evo-era private server) as a new appended ID: STB row, `LIST_WEAPON.ZSC` model object (with mesh/material dedup), ground-drop model (`--copy-field-model`), STL name/desc key, and any missing mesh/texture files. Always start with `--dry-run`; it makes `.bak` backups and verifies after writing. `scripts/add-item-icon.py` adds a custom item icon from a PNG (any size, auto-downscaled to a 40×40 cell) to the `ITEM1.TSI` atlas and prints the new global icon index (`--weapon-row N` also patches the STB); requires Pillow. Both docstrings document the underlying binary formats — read them before editing STB/ZSC/STL/TSI by hand.

Key facts: weapon visuals come from `LIST_WEAPON.ZSC` indexed by item number (1:1 with STB rows) — the STB "model file" text column is vestigial and never read by the game. Ground-drop visuals are a separate index (STB col 10) into `LIST_FieldITEM.ZSC`. Icon indices are global sprite positions in `ITEM1.TSI` (originally 50 sheets × 169 cells = 0–8449; extension sheets `icon51.dds`+ continue from 8450). After data edits, restart servers (they cache STBs at startup) and the client.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Always build via the .sln, not individual .vcxproj files.** Projects depend on `$(SolutionDir)` and `$(GeneratedDirCommon)` (→ `build/gen/common/`) from `rose-next.props`. These don't resolve when building a vcxproj standalone. Use: `MSBuild.exe rose-next.sln -p:Configuration=release;Platform=x86 -t:sho_gameserver`
- The `common.vcxproj` pre-build step runs `cargo build`, so building via the solution handles Rust automatically
- Always build Rust with i686 toolchain — the entire project is 32-bit x86
- FlatBuffers schemas in `src/common-lib/packets/` must be compiled with `flatc` (handled by build.rs)
- `src/common-lib/build.rs` uses `PROFILE` env var (not `DEBUG`) to find flatc path
- Server projects link against Rust staticlib output — build Rust before C++
- Thirdparty must be built before rose-next.sln
